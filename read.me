I used only html and js to make my game. 

I used arrays, functions, if statements, if else statements, innerHtml, .push etc to run for the correct guess, incorrect guess. Also to randomize the word that's being played at the time. The if and if else was used to check for corect and incorrect guesses along with checking to see if the game was won or not.

I used Google for a large amount of this project to figure it out. Since I am still stuglling with functions, especially loops/statements(if, let etc). But no matter what I could not figure out how to make it more than one player.

I used six images I found online to make my hangman appear on the webpage and put the source of the image into both my HTML(the steak) and the actually body parts into my js.
